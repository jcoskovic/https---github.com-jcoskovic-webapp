; --- Coverage (optional) ---
; To enable code coverage in tests, install either PCOV (preferred) or Xdebug.
; PCOV is faster and recommended for CI. The extension is enabled in the Dockerfile.
; Enable PCOV runtime and scope it to your app directory:
pcov.enabled=1
pcov.directory=/var/www/app

; For Xdebug coverage instead (do not enable both at once):
; zend_extension=xdebug.so
; xdebug.mode=coverage
